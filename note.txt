We just published our 
local git repo to remote
github.com repository.
Few things happened:
1) New remote repo was created
2) A link was made between local and remote repo

Now our work will continue locally.
1. Add a new file called note.txt
2. Committed the change to local repo
3. We want this change to be reflected on remote repository
4. We push local commit to remote repo using push origin button
5. Observe it has been added in your repository under github.com
